addopts = --strict-markers

markers =
	functional: mark a test as a functional test (deselect with '-m "not functional"'). These tests exercise functional requirements of TOGA and tend to run longer than unit tests.

	unit: mark a test as a unit test (deselect with '-m "not unit"'). These tests exercise individual units (such as standalone functions or class methods) of TOGA and tend to run much faster than functional tests.
